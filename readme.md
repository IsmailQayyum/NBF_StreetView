# NBF_StreetView Dataset

## Description

This dataset is designed to simulate real-world challenges faced by autonomous vehicles, particularly when encountering degraded images through sensors in various street environments. It includes a diverse set of images from streetview and pedestrian walkways, subjected to various types of degradation such as noise, blur, and flare, mimicking the environmental conditions that can affect sensor performance in automotive applications. The dataset captures a variety of scenes, including vehicles, people, and street scenes, providing a comprehensive representation of potential challenges in visual processing.

### Key Features:
- Diverse set of images from streetview and pedestrian walkways
- Simulated sensor degradation (noise, blur, and flare)
- Variety of scenes including vehicles, people, and street environments
- Ideal for deep learning tasks such as image restoration, denoising, deblurring, and flare correction

## Usage

Ideal for deep learning and computer vision tasks, this dataset offers a robust resource for training and evaluating models focused on enhancing the resilience and accuracy of autonomous vehicle systems in degraded visual environments.
